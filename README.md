**Enterprise-grade data solutions** across HR, retail, logistics, and financial domains.

## HR Analytics: Attrition Prediction

**Problem**: 32% annual turnover impacting operations  
**Solution**:  
✔ Random Forest/XGBoost models (85% accuracy)  
✔ Key predictors: Tenure, salary bands, performance metrics  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # 85% test accuracy

Impact: Early intervention reduced turnover by 18% in Q3

Customer Feedback Analysis
Problem: 2-week manual review cycles
Solution:
✔ BERT-based sentiment analysis pipeline
✔ Automated text preprocessing (spaCy/NLTK)

Metric	Score
Accuracy	92%
Processing Time	4.2s/100 reviews
Impact: 30% faster response to critical issues
